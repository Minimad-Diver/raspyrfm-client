xs1-api-client
==============

A python library for accessing actuator and sensor data on the the EZcontrolÂ® XS1 Gateway using their HTTP API.

How to use
==========

Installation
------------

:code:`pip install xs1-api-client`

Usage
-----

For a basic example have a look at the `example.py <https://github.com/markusressel/xs1-api-client/blob/master/example.py>`_ file.
If you need more info have a look at the `documentation <http://xs1-api-client.readthedocs.io/>`_ which should help.

Basic Example
-------------
Import required modules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. code-block:: python

   from raspyrfm_client import RaspyRFMClient
   from raspyrfm_client.device import actions
   from raspyrfm_client.device.manufacturer import manufacturer_constants


Create the `RaspyRFMClient` object
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you know the IP and Port of your RaspyRFM you can pass them as arguments:

.. code-block:: python

   rfm_client = RaspyRFMClient("192.168.2.10", 9876)

or

.. code-block:: python

   rfm_client = RaspyRFMClient("192.168.2.10") # defaults to port 49880

Otherwise you can just create it without.

.. code-block:: python

   rfm_client = RaspyRFMClient()

and then let the client search for the RaspyRFM with:

.. code-block:: python

   ip = rfm_client.search()

This will return an `IP address` if a RaspyRFM module was found.

Get a Device
^^^^^^^^^^^^

To get a quick overview of what manufacturers and models are supported call:

.. code-block:: python

   rfm_client.list_supported_devices()

which will give you a indented list of supported manufacturers and their supported models. Use the names in this list to get a device in the next step.

To generate codes for a device you first have to get an instance of its implementation. Use the following method to get just that:

.. code-block:: python

   brennenstuhl_rcs1000 = rfm_client.get_device(manufacturer_constants.BRENNENSTUHL,
                                             manufacturer_constants.RCS_1000_N_COMFORT)

It is always a good choice to only use values present in `manufacturer_constants` but if needed this can also be a `string`. These should always be the same values as the ones printed by the `list_supported_devices()` method.

Generate action codes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Now that you have an implementation instance you can generate codes for supported actions by using an `actions` constant that you imported previously.

To get a list of supported actions call:

.. code-block:: python

   brennenstuhl_rcs1000.get_supported_actions()

and generate a code with:

.. code-block:: python

   code = brennenstuhl_rcs1000.generate_code(actions.ON)

Send the code to the RaspyRFM module
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To send a code for your device of choice you can combine the two objects in this call:

.. code-block:: python

   rfm_client.send(brennenstuhl_rcs1000, actions.ON)
